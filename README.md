# cmlMinimal
This code implements a hybrid diffusively coupled map lattice (CML) and globally coupled map (GCM).
This is something like a lattice of balanced networks with a small world network hopping between (small world dynamics are shown to be similar to GCM).
This code is currently under test and unsupported. Stay tuned!
It is generally working, but some values of slider settings will cause a numerical problem.
